* Agda-ventures with PolyP
(PolyP at 30)

This repository contains [[file:src/PolyP30.lagda][the literate Agda file]] which doubles as the
LaTeX source for [[file:GibbonsJansson_PolyP30.pdf][the paper]] and the Agda code in it.

The Agda code typechecks at least with version 2.7.0.1 of Agda and
version 2.2 of the Agda standard library.

The paper is a chapter in a Festschrift for Johan Jeuring's 60:th
birthday celebration: JohanFest, Utrecht, 2025-09-19.

At JohanFest, Patrik Jansson presented [[file:2025-09_JohanFest_Jansson_PolyP30.pdf][some slides]] based on the paper
and recollections from our joint work over the decades.
