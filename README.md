# Agda-ventures with PolyP
(PolyP at 30)

This repository contains the literate Agda file which doubles as the LaTeX source for the paper and the Agda code in it.

The paper is a chapter in the Festschrift for Johan Jeuring's 60:th birthday.

The Agda code typechecks at least with version 2.7.0.1 of Agda and version 2.2 of the Agda standard library.
