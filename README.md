# Agda-ventures with PolyP
(PolyP at 30)

This repository contains [the literate Agda file](src/PolyP30.lagda) which doubles as the LaTeX source for [the paper](GibbonsJansson_PolyP30.pdf) and the Agda code in it.

The paper is a chapter in a Festschrift for Johan Jeuring's 60:th birthday.

The Agda code typechecks at least with version 2.7.0.1 of Agda and version 2.2 of the Agda standard library.
